# House price prediction
## Aim
To create a Machine Learning model that predicts the price of the house by taking the features like land size, house size, nnumber of rooms, number of bath rooms, distance to school,super market, and also the availability of parking spot, water front, swimmijng pool e.t.c
## Approach
At first we import the required libraries for creating a model using linear regression which will suits the best for the dataset.

Next we clean the data by encoding the catogorical data into numerics.

And then we split the test and training data.

Next we do the feature scaling for the data for better results.

Then we train the model with training data.

Then we se the predictions and check them with the original data.

And will calculate the efficiency of the moddel using R square method which we got is near to 98%.
