# Iris Petal Classification
## Aim
To create a Machine Learning model that classifies the Iris petals by taking the features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width.
## Approach
At first we import the required libraries for creating a model using linear regression which will suits the best for the dataset.

Next we make sure that tthere are no missing values in the dataset and then clean the data by encoding the catogorical data into numerics.

And then we split the test and training data.

Next we do the feature scaling for the data for better results.

Then we train the model that best suits the dataset with training data.

There are several classification models like logistic regression, support vector machine, random forests e.t.c

First I used the support vector machine that gave 100% accuracy, which means that the model got overfit.

So I used Random forest model to train the classifier.

Then we se the predictions and check them with the original data.

And will calculate the efficiency of the moddel using R square method which we got is near to 98%.
