# Wine Quality Prediction
## Aim
To create a Machine Learning model that predicts the quality of the wine by taking the features like alcohol content, malic acid, ash, magnesium, phenols, flavanoids, color intensity, hue, proline e.t.c.
## Approach
At first we import the required libraries for creating a model using linear regression which will suits the best for the dataset.

Next we check whether the given data doesnot have any missing values, and if , then we fill them using the stategies like mean, most frequent e.t.c

And then we split the test and training data.

Next we do the feature scaling for the data for better results.

Then we train the Linear regression model with training data.

Then we se the predictions and check them with the original data.

And will calculate the efficiency of the moddel using R square method which we got is near to 76%.
